1. D3 In depth: https://www.d3indepth.com/introduction/
2. D3 + React: https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-d3-js-react/

Task: Generate a standard scatter plot (lines optional) of single option chain expiration (use the data at single-expiration-data.json)

X-axis: Strikes
Y-Axis: Last Price
Datasets: Puts, Calls

Future Considerations: 
be able to load multiple expiration datasets. 
be able to load the same paramters data but with multiple collection times. (when the snapshot was taken)
