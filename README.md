Task: 
1. Clone this repository (in vs code terminal, `git clone https://github.com/mledan/d3-sample-charts/`
2. create a new branch  `git checkout -b "your-branch-name"`
3. Set up a react app with Create React App command. `create-react-app your-name-for-the-app`
4. add d3 to the starter project `npm install d3`

Future Considerations: 
be able to load multiple expiration datasets. 
be able to load the same paramters data but with multiple collection times. (when the snapshot was taken)
